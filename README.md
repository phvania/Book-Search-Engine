## Description:
This application is a search engine for books. The user is presented with a search input field and submit button, as well as an option to login or signup. A search will result in several results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. One must be logged in to enable the capability to save books, which are compiled into a retrievable list with the option to remove previously saved titles.

Behind the scenes, it consists of a Google Books API search engine, built with a RESTful API, which is then refactored to be a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. It is a full-stack MERN application (MongoDB-Express.js-React-Node.js), deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.

## Installation:
In order to run this application, you will want to git clone this repository so that the code is on your local machine. Run npm i while in the client folder in order to install all necessary front-end Node.js dependencies. Run npm i again while in the server folder in order to install any back-end dependancies. Then run npm start from either the root directory OR both the client and server folders CONCURRENTLY to launch the server.

This application is hosted at Port 3001, so typing: http://localhost:3001/ into the address bar of your browser (while the server is running) should display the user interface.
